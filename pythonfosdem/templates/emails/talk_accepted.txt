We still have a few questions:
1. Could you confirm your talk ?

2. Could you send us your talk one week before the FOSDEM ? 
   We want to have the best experience for the speaker without any problem with the beamer

3. We thought to offer you a t-shirt, could you please tell us your size ?

4. Do you have all the information concerning your arrival in Belgium (Travel and Hotel) ?


There is a mailing list for the Python Devroom python-devroom@lists.fosdem.org,

There will be a beer event in a restaurant organised by the Belgian Python Community on saturday night.
We are really sorry but we can not refund your expenses for this talk.


For this edition, we will follow the same Code of Conduct as the pycon US [4]
